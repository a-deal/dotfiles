# Overview

This folder contains a scraper that will target Raw Strength
and Conditioning's blog sites to pull programming archives for
specific templates (Aesthetics, Gymnastics, Cardio Bodybuilding)

## The Plan

Build a scraper that should

- Pull the blog archive for each template
- Navigate to each day's program
- Parse the day's page for the contained workout
- Output days programming into json blob (in-memory)
- Repeat until scraper has navigated the entire archive
- Output in-memory representation into file
